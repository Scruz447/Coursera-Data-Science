## Which major city should you visit if you love Japanese food?

### *Data section*

I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of Japanese restaurants in 5 major US cities which are: New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and Chicago. These are some of the most popular US cities to visit according to Trip Advisor and I believe that these cities have some of the best Japanese food the United States can offer. I will use the latitude and longitude of the cities within an API request to pull back the name, address and geospatial data on Japanese restaurants in the area. We will use this data to determine which city would be best to visit and reserve a hotel room.
