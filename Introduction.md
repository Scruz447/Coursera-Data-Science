## Which major city should you visit if you love Japanese food?

### *Introduction*

So, you love Japanese food so much that you can eat it for every meal. And you would like to visit a major city for a nice vacation and would like you endulge in your favorite cuisine but dont know where to go. This is the problem I aim to solve with my report by analyzing the density of Japanese restaurants in some major US cities. While not important to some, this report will help the tourist that would like to visit a popular destination in the US, that has a huge appetite for sushi and the like.
