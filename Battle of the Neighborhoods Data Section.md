## Which major city should you visit if you love Japanese food?

### *Introduction*

So you love Japanese food so much that you can eat it for every meal. And you would like to visit a major city for a nice vacation and would like you endulge in your favorite cuisine but dont know where to go. This is the problem I aim to solve by analyzng the density of Japanese restaurants in some major US cities.

### *Data section*

I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of Japanese restaurants in 5 major US cities which are: New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and Chicago. These are some of the most popular US cities to visit accordig to Trip Advisor and I believe that these cities have some of the best Japanese food the United States can offer.
